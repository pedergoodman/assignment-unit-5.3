    <ul>
      <li>I can create an object and add it to the array, does each object need a 
        name as well? Or is in sufficient to allow the object.. not sure what I'm asking here. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>I kept trying to console log showCollection() and I was getting a return of undefined, which makes sense because showCollection()
        logs everything out within the function and returns nothing, so when I tried to log the function after it ran, it return and printed
         "undefined"
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Working on stretch goals</strong></li>
      <li>I'm working out how to input the array to the function addToCollection(), It seems I can just put an array in as an argument, 
        but that gets hard to read/manage very quickly if I want to add 2+ tracks. It also looks like each item in the array 
        should be a <em>track object</em> with a name and duration property. Lots of layers here. Curious if I'm thinking about this in the right way.            
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>    
      <li><strong>3 ways I'm thinking about this/questions I have.</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Is writing inputting an array in as an argument too cumbersome? is there an easier way?</li>
        <li>I'm thinking of predefining an array of tracks and then inputting it in addToCollection as an argument</li>
        <li>Also planning on making a function to add tracks to a track array</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
